Python API documentation
========================

While this project is not designed to be used as a library, everyone benefits
from well-documented code. Hence, we use Sphinx's autodoc extension to create
the following Python API docs from our docstrings:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   python/api
   python/api.analysis
   python/api.analysis.plugins
   python/pdfutil
